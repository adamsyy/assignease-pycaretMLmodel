# assignease-pycaretMLmodel

This repository contains a Python machine learning project that utilizes PyCarrot's Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) regression model for predictive analysis. The project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for automating the machine learning process, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection.

## Features

- Uses PyCarrot, a Python library for automating machine learning tasks.
- Utilizes LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, for regression tasks.
- Implements gradient-based one-sided sampling for informative data selection.
- Employs a leaf-wise tree growth strategy to optimize efficiency.
- Integrates cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamsyy/assignease-pycaretMLmodel.git
   cd assignease-pycaretMLmodel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
